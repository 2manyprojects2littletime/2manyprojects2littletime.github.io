# Liquidity is important

Have I ever told you of the time I mistakenly racked up like $2000 of long distance charges at a hotel?

it was the vacation that Steph and I got engaged on.  We were going to meet at a island resort, but I was due to arrive at the destination a few days ahead of her, so I got a room near the airport and lounged around waiting for her to arrive.

This was the maldives, so the surrounds were beautiful and I spent most of the days wandering. I hadn’t gotten her engagement ring yet, so I checked out some local jewelry stores. The capital island is only a couple square kilometers so I walked around most of the island in the first few hours.  Then night hit and I realised it was an Islamic country and while I’m sure there was some sort of night life it certainly didn’t look like what I expected or knew to look for.  So I stayed up at the cafe until it closed then headed back to the hotel.

I had some international calling cards so I figured I’d give Steph a call.  I dialed them up and punched in the numbers and got a message I wasn’t used to, but I couldn’t really tell what it meant.  Long story short it meant “you bought the wrong fucking calling card.”

I was only there a couple nights, but every evening I’d call Steph and we’d talk for an hour or so.  “This is nice” I thought.

When I went to check out there was like 700 minutes at 2.50USD/minute in call charges to the room.

And the whole vacation had been put on my credit card, which was now almost maxed.  I had been living on cash and had a few hundred dollars of spending limit in case of emergency, but hadn’t predicted an emergency of this magnitude.

So I ‘checked out’ of my room, left my bags with the desk as collateral and went to the airport. Steph landed, she had been travelling for about 26h now and wanted nothing to do but to fall into the king sized bed at our resort.  She asked me if I had found out where the slip for the private water taxi to the resort was.  I told her we’d have to go back to Male, and oh by the way, how much money do you have?

She had some travelling money, but nowhere near $2k.  She was in university at the time and I think her like total credit limit was only $1000 or something.

She had a student line of credit though, her father was a co signer on the account and I think he got copies of the statements.  I convinced her to lend me the money off of that, and I would put the money back on payday, which I think was a few days away.  Then we had to backtrack to Male, hike back to the hotel, call her bank to let them know a unusually large international charge was going to be placed, pay the hotel, get my backs, hike back to the airport, and hang out for a few extra hours for next water taxi.

It was a tense few hours.  Also it definitely didn’t do any favours for her father’s view of me.  Oh and she didn’t get her own engagement ring because of it.  I had planned to go back to the jewellry shop on the way to the airport and pick up a local customary engagement ring, which was a pink pearl instead of diamond.  Instead she wore a signet ring of mine on a chain around her neck for a few months and then I got her a traditional diamond ring.  And to assuage my remaining guilt I spent far too much on it.  She appreciated that.
