# Real-Estate is Safety
---

I’ve been thinking a lot about psychological safety lately.  I had the realization this morning that while real estate investing started out as a way to increase my financial security, it has over time become part of my ‘psychological safety net.’

Software is currently experiencing a boom. This lends itself to job mobility.  Job mobility is a funny thing, though: while it somewhat guarantees I won't be without work for a long period when I want it, short term it means that I'm much less certain of exactly where the next paycheque will come from.

That ties into safety because generally I like paycheques and I dislike uncertainty.  This creates stress in my life.  To combat that stress as a family we've decided to diversify our income streams.  We started by investing in income properties.  Over the years we've also added traditional investments shares of company equity and debt that we hold mostly in tax advantaged accounts, and mostly for the tax advantages.  After our experiences over the past year renovating a property to increase its income potential we are now considering adding business holdings into the mix, which have many tax advantages as well as income streams.
